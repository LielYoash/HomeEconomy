# ASP.NET WebForms Frontend

This project is the frontend component of an ASP.NET WebForms application.

## Getting Started

Before running the frontend, ensure that the backend is built and running. Follow the steps below:

### Build the Backend

1. Clone the backend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/backend.git
Build the backend using your preferred build tool or IDE.

2. Configure Frontend to Use Backend
In your ASP.NET WebForms frontend project, update the path to the bakelibrary.dll file in the relevant configuration. This file is used to communicate with the backend.

Open the configuration file (Web.config or any other relevant configuration file) and look for a configuration setting related to the backend DLL or service. Update the path to point to the correct location of bakelibrary.dll.

3.Running the Frontend
Now that the backend is built and configured, you can run the frontend:

3.1Open the solution in Visual Studio.

3.2Build the solution.

3.3Run the project.

The frontend should now be able to communicate with the backend using the specified bakelibrary.dll.
